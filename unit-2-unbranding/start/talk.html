<p>We need to talk.</p>
<p>Ok, what about? Is everything ok?</p>
<p>No, everything is not ok! I just finished season 1 of the last show you told me I absolutely had to watch!</p>
<p>Oh yeah,that is definitely not ok.</p>
<p>I know that! Why didn't you tell me they were going to die?! Maybe give me a little warning?!</p>
<p>I wasn't about to spoil the twist! You wouldn't have appreciated it as much.</p>
<p>Appreciated?! I would ahve appreciated some preparation for the devestation I have been forced to witness! You left me unprepared and now everything is terrible and horrible and I'll never recover!</p>
<p>Ok, calm down, you'll live.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I won't be happy about it!</p>
<p>Oh, just you wait until you watch season 2.</p>
<p>WHAT?! What does that mean?! What's going to happen?</p>
<p> I don't know, you'll just have to wait and see!</p>
<p>Well, now I don't want to. I have no reason to trust your judgement.</p>
<p>C'mon, you have to watch the next season, there's a new character that is basically you in a different font. I need you to see you in a different universe and hear your thoughts about it.</p>
<p>Fine, fine, ok, I'll watch it. But this is the last time I listen to your recommendations.</p>
<p>Uh huh, you keep saying that but you always come crawling back once the credits roll.</p>
