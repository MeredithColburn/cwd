<p class="Hannah">We need to talk.</p>
<p class="Maya">Ok, what's up? Is everything ok?</p>
<p class="Hannah">No, everything is not ok! I just finished season 1 
<br>
of the last show you told me I absolutely had to watch!</p>
<p class="Maya">Oh yeah,that is definitely not ok.</p>
<p class="Hannah">I know that! Why didn't you tell me they were
  <br>
 going to die?! Maybe give me a little warning?!</p>
<p class="Maya">I wasn't about to spoil the twist!
<br>
 You wouldn't have appreciated it as much.</p>
<p class="Hannah">Appreciated?! I would have appreciated 
<br>
some preparation for the devestation I have been 
<br>
forced to witness! You left me unprepared and 
<br>
now everything is terrible and horrible
<br>
and I'll never recover!</p>
<p class="Maya">Ok, calm down, you'll live.</p>
<p class="Hannah">Yeah, but I won't be happy about it!</p>
<p class="Maya">Oh, just you wait until you watch season 2.</p>
<p class="Hannah">WHAT?! What does that mean?! 
<br>
What's going to happen?</p>
<p class="Maya"> I don't know, you'll just have to wait and see!</p>
<p class="Hannah">Well, now I don't want to. 
<br>
I have no reason to trust your judgement.</p>
<p class="Maya">C'mon, you have to watch the next season,
<br>
 there's a new character that is basically you in a 
<br>
different font. I need you to see you in a 
<br>
different universe and hear your thoughts about it.</p>
<p class="Hannah">Fine, fine, ok, I'll watch it. But this 
<br>
is the last time I listen to your recommendations.</p>
<p class="Maya">Uh huh, you keep saying that
<br>
 but you always come crawling back
<br>
  once the credits roll.</p>
